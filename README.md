# mips-n64-toolchain

This repo holds my mips-n64 toolchain which is meant for use with my Modern SDK. It functions as a good general-purpose compiler for the N64. newlib and C++ (with stdlibs) are both built and supported.

It is recommended to install with the provided DEB or RPM in the releases section. Building it yourself isn't recommended, but can be done with `build-toolchain.sh`.
